# Animusic
Animusic is a Python package that allows you to easily create animated music videos with beautiful audio-reactive visual effects. All you need to do is provide an image or a video that you'd like to animate, as well as an audio file, and the rest is done for you!

## Features
* Uses [**librosa**](https://librosa.org/) to filter and process the audio in order to translate the beats and sounds into visual effect intensity.
* Uses different effects for different frequencies to create more dynamic and responsive animations.
* Can animate both images and videos.
* Supports all major image, video, and audio formats.
* Includes a user-friendly GUI made with [**PySimpleGUI**](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI).
* No tweaking necessary - the animation algorithm was specifically designed to work well out-of-the-box for most types of music.

## Showcase
**Note:** You may need to unmute the videos in order to hear the audio.
